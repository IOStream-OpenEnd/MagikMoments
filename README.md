#Action Plan
To complete the project we need to do the following task one by one.
-Find a Python Module that can take video file (.mp4 or something) and convert it into frames.
-implement that module into our code.
-Save the frames into an array.
-Check which frames are magic moments using images processing and machine learning.
-Convert those frames into a video.
-Output the video.

The whole project will most probably be in 2 or 3 modules.
One will be for input/output. Another will implement machine learning.
