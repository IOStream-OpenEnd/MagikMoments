# Action Plan

To complete the project we need to do the following task one by one.

- [x] Find a Python Module that can take video file (.mp4 or something) and convert it into frames. (OpenCV)

- [x] implement that module into our code. (Creating frames)

- [ ] Save the frames into an array.

- [ ] Check which frames are magic moments using images processing and machine learning.

- [x] Convert those frames into a video. (Merging frames)

The whole project will most probably be in 2 or 3 modules.

One will be for input/output. Another will implement machine learning.
