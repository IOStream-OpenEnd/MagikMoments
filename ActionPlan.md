## Action Plan for Complete Project (Revised) :

To complete the project we need to do the following task one by one.

- [x] Create frames of given video, every 5 seconds.

- [x] Detect faces from the frames. Should be able to detect multiple faces in one image.

- [ ] Detect hyper emotion from the faces.

- [x] Use timestamps or array or something to store the exact time/frame for the trim.

- [x] For each hyper emotion(more like so much emotion), from the original video create a mini video containing 2 secs before the emotion and 2 secs after.

- [x] Include audio in those mini videos. Either don't remove it during the trim or add it appropriately as per the original later. 

- [x] Combine all the mini videos into a single.

- [ ] Perform Test Driven Development (TDD) using any testing framework.

- [ ] Create documentation for the project.
